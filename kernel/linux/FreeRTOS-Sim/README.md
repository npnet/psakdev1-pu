# FreeRTOS-Sim
FreeRTOS simulator for POSIX (Linux, OS X and maybe other POSIX OS)

Based on the Linux simulator originally developed by William Davy, the goal of this work is to keep FreeRTOS POSIX simulator in a clean seperate package and up to date with the latest FreeRTOS releases.

Directory description
- Source: FreeRTOS kernel and POSIX simulator source files
- Project: the project directory that includes main() and FreeRTOS settings for the POSIX port
- Demo: demo tasks from the official FreeRTOS release

### Note
V10 is added to the master branch without extensive tests. Feel free to report or fix bugs.



This is a Project forked from [megakilo](https://github.com/megakilo/FreeRTOS-Sim), he had archived his repo, and I can't push a merge to him about supporing macOS Mojave and cmake support.

so I start a new clean [repo](https://github.com/shlinym/FreeRTOS-POSIX) supporting Mojave and cmake, if you have any questions, you can start a issue on it.
